      <h3 class="mt-0">1. Super Typhoon Safety Guidelines</h3>

      <p>
        In the event of a super typhoon, it is crucial to prioritize safety measures. Stay informed about weather
        updates through reliable sources and follow evacuation orders if issued. Secure your home by reinforcing doors
        and windows, and stock up on essential supplies such as food, water, and medications. Create an emergency kit
        and have a communication plan with family members. If evacuation becomes necessary, move to higher ground and
        seek shelter in designated evacuation centers. During the typhoon, stay indoors, away from windows, and avoid
        going outside until authorities declare it safe to do so.
      </p>

      <h3 class="mt-0">2. Earthquake Safety Guidelines</h3>

      <p>
        Earthquakes can happen suddenly, so it's crucial to know how to protect yourself. Drop to the ground, take cover
        under a sturdy piece of furniture, and hold on until the shaking stops. If you are indoors, stay inside, away
        from windows, and avoid doorways. If you are outside, move to an open area away from buildings, trees, and
        streetlights. After the shaking stops, be cautious of aftershocks and check for injuries. Have an emergency kit
        with essential supplies, including first aid items, and be familiar with evacuation routes if necessary.
      </p>

      <h3 class="mt-0">3. Flood Safety Guidelines</h3>

      <p>
        Flooding can pose serious risks, so it's important to be prepared. If you live in a flood-prone area, know the
        elevation of your property and the flood risk in your community. During heavy rainfall or flood warnings,
        monitor weather updates and be ready to evacuate if necessary. Avoid walking or driving through flooded areas,
        as the depth and current can be deceptive and dangerous. Move to higher ground and seek shelter if flooding is
        imminent. Ensure that your emergency kit includes essentials such as a flashlight, batteries, non-perishable
        food, and important documents stored in a waterproof container.
      </p>

      <h3 class="mt-0">4. Evacuation Safety Guidelines</h3>

      <p>
        In case of evacuation orders, it is essential to act promptly and efficiently. Follow the instructions provided
        by local authorities and evacuate to designated shelters or safe areas. Pack a comprehensive emergency kit,
        including personal identification, medications, important documents, and essential supplies. Turn off utilities
        in your home before leaving and secure your property as much as possible. Stay informed about evacuation routes
        and traffic conditions. If you have pets, make arrangements for their evacuation as well. Listen to official
        updates for information on when it is safe to return home.
      </p>

      <h3 class="mt-0">5. Fire Safety Guidelines</h3>

      <p>
        Fire safety is crucial to protect lives and property. In the event of a fire, prioritize the safety of yourself
        and others. If you discover a fire, immediately call emergency services and alert those around you. Evacuate the
        building calmly and use designated exits. If you are trapped, stay low to the ground, cover your mouth with a
        cloth, and signal for help from a window. Familiarize yourself with the location of fire extinguishers and fire
        exits in your surroundings. Regularly check smoke detectors and have a fire escape plan in place. Remember,
        prevention is key, so be cautious with flammable materials and electrical appliances.
      </p>

      <h1 class="mt-0">6. Robbery Safety Guidelines</h1>
      <p>
        If you find yourself in a situation where someone is knocking on your door and you suspect a potential robbery,
        it's important to prioritize your safety. Avoid opening the door to strangers, especially if you weren't
        expecting anyone. Use peepholes or windows to verify the identity of the person knocking. If you feel uneasy or
        threatened, do not hesitate to call emergency services immediately. Keep doors and windows locked at all times,
        and consider installing security measures such as doorbell cameras or motion-activated lights. Establish a code
        word with trusted family members or neighbors that can be used to alert them in case of an emergency. Remember,
        your safety is the top priority, so trust your instincts and take appropriate action to protect yourself and
        your home.
